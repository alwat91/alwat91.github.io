# Approach
When planning this game, a similar structure to the Tic Tac Toe game from our homework made sense to me. I decided to create my game using a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. In JavaScript, the game consists of a view engine, game engine, and game controller. The core logic of the game engine is handled as a 2D array in which new pieces are pushed to the array in a given column.
